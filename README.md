Events
===

This repository for my diploma project in computer science.

Goal of the project is help people find information about public events all over the world. This would be a web application build on modern technologies. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) + [postrges](http://www.postgresql.org)([Sequelize ORM](http://sequelizejs.com)) on server. [Materializecss](http://materializecss.com) + [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) on client side.
